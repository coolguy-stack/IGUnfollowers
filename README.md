# IGUnfollowers

A side project I built to automate the process of viewing who unfollowed my Instagram account and then subsequently unfollowing them back. I 
used Python and the knowledge of JSON files to manipulate my follower/following data and then single out the unfollowers on my account.

To use this, simply go on a web version of your Instagram account, go to Settings > Your Activity > Download Your Information > JSON.
Instagram will send you JSON files of your information and you will drag and drop the "followers.json" and "following.json" files to replace my
files of the same name. That will give you the list of unfollowers of your account.

In this project, I learned file manipiulation, basic dataset sorting, JSON, Instagram API and developed my problem-solving brain.

Thanks for visiting!
